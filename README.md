<h1>Questions</h1>
<p>
	1	What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)
	⁃	I used html, css, js, and bootstrap 5. I used vue because I wanted to create a modular design using vue components and I used bootstrap to take advantage of their grid system and make styling easier.
	2	Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose
	⁃	I encounter challenges when styling for mobile viewports. Images were not scaling as expected and looked different on a mobile device than in the browsers dev tools. 
	3	What you enjoyed the most and why
	⁃	I most enjoyed creating the animations for the icons because it’s not something I’ve had much experience with, but I learned something new and I’ll be having fun discovering and coming up with new animations in the future.
